# Arduino Python Controller Project Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a desktop application that enables users to write and execute Python code on an Arduino microcontroller. The application provides a user-friendly interface for writing code, managing Arduino connections, and controlling the Arduino's built-in LED using Python commands through the pyFirmata library.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Application Architecture
The application is built using the following technologies:
- Electron.js for the desktop application framework
- Node.js for the backend processes
- Python with pyFirmata for Arduino communication
- HTML/CSS for the user interface

The architecture follows a three-tier structure:
1. Frontend (Electron renderer process)
2. Backend (Electron main process)
3. Python bridge (Arduino communication layer)

### 2. Key Features

#### 2.1 Code Entry Interface
- Large, syntax-aware text area (500px height)
- Monospace font for better code readability
- Vertical resizing capability
- Syntax error detection before code execution
- Clear button for resetting the code area

#### 2.2 Connection Management
- Automatic serial port detection and listing
- Real-time connection status indicator
- Connect/Disconnect functionality
- Port refresh capability
- Error handling for connection failures

#### 2.3 Code Execution
- Python code compilation and execution
- Real-time feedback on code execution status
- Error handling for syntax and runtime errors
- Safe execution environment with restricted namespace
- Automatic cleanup on disconnection

### 3. Arduino Integration

#### 3.1 Firmata Implementation
The application uses the Firmata protocol through pyFirmata to communicate with the Arduino. This enables:
- Direct pin control from Python code
- Real-time command execution
- Bi-directional communication
- Built-in LED control (pin 13)

#### 3.2 LED Control Functionality
Users can control the Arduino's built-in LED (pin 13) through Python code. Example implementation:
```python
# Blink LED example
while True:
    led.write(1)  # Turn LED on
    time.sleep(1)
    led.write(0)  # Turn LED off
    time.sleep(1)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Arduino Setup
1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB
2. Open Arduino IDE
3. Go to File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
4. Click Upload to flash the Firmata firmware to your Arduino
5. Wait for the "Upload Complete" message

### 2. Application Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
pip install pyfirmata
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Using the Application
1. Select the appropriate serial port from the dropdown menu
2. Click "Connect" to establish communication with the Arduino
3. Enter Python code in the text area
4. Click "Upload" to execute the code
5. Monitor the status indicator for feedback
